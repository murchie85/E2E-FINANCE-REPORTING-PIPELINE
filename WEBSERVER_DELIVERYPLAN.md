# Deliverable: Web Server for Generating Log Data  

The web server will be responsible for generating log data for forex exchange rates, stock prices, and a stock news feed. The log data will be sent to the Kinesis stream for ingestion into the pipeline.

## Features Required:  

- The web server must be able to generate log data for forex exchange rates, stock prices, and a stock news feed.
- The log data must be in a format that can be ingested by the Kinesis stream.
- The web server must be able to send the log data to the Kinesis stream in real-time.
- The web server must be scalable and able to handle a high volume of log data.
  

## Possible Solutions: 

- Use a managed web server solution such as Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine to host the web server.
- Use a web framework such as Flask or Express.js to implement the web server and generate the log data.
- Use a database solution such as Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL to store the log data and retrieve it for generating the logs.
- Use the AWS Kinesis Client Library or the Google Cloud Client Library to send the log data to the Kinesis stream or Google Pub/Sub.  

## Timeline:   

- Week 1: Research and select a managed web server solution and web framework.
- Week 2: Implement the web server and generate log data for forex exchange rates and stock prices.
- Week 3: Implement the log data storage and retrieval system using a database solution.
- Week 4: Integrate the web server with the Kinesis stream or Google Pub/Sub to send log data in real-time.
- Week 5: Test and optimize the web server for scalability and performance.
- Week 6: Finalize the web server and prepare for delivery.  


## Automating the Log Generation 
  
One way to generate the log data every minute is to use a background task or worker that runs the generate_logs function on a regular schedule. There are several ways you could implement this, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
  
One approach is to use a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism to run the generate_logs function every minute. This would involve setting up a cron job that runs the generate_logs function on a schedule, such as every minute, using a command like curl to make a request to the /logs endpoint of the Flask app. This approach would require setting up the cron job on the server where the Flask app is running, and it may not be the most efficient way to run the task on a regular schedule.
  
Another approach is to use a task queue or a message queue to manage the background tasks that generate the log data. This would involve adding the generate_logs function to a task queue, and setting up a worker process or service that monitors the queue and executes the tasks on a regular schedule. This approach would allow you to run the generate_logs function asynchronously and on a regular schedule, without having to manage the scheduling and execution of the tasks manually. Some popular task queue libraries that you could use with Flask include Celery, RQ, and Huey.
  
Regardless of the approach you choose, it is important to ensure that the generate_logs function is designed to be efficient and to handle failures gracefully. This may involve implementing retry logic, error handling, and other techniques to ensure that the function can run reliably and without impacting the performance of the application.

# WEB SERVER CONSIDERATIONS 

Performance: The web server should be able to handle a high volume of requests and deliver the data quickly and efficiently. This may require optimizing the implementation of the server, using caching or other techniques to reduce the amount of time required to generate and serve the data.
Reliability: The web server should be able to withstand failures and continue serving data even in the face of unexpected errors or downtime. This may require implementing redundancy and backup mechanisms, such as load balancing or backup servers, to ensure that the server remains available even if individual components fail.
Security: The web server should be secure, protecting the data it serves and preventing unauthorized access or modifications. This may require implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as encryption and other security measures to protect the data from being accessed or tampered with.
Scalability: The web server should be able to scale up or down as needed to accommodate changes in the volume or type of requests it receives. This may require implementing mechanisms to automatically adjust the number of servers or other resources used by the server, or to add or remove servers as needed to ensure that the server can continue serving data effectively.
By taking these factors into account and implementing the web server in a way that addresses these concerns, you can ensure that the server is able to deliver the data efficiently, reliably, and securely.




## SAMPLE CODE

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import boto3

# Set up the Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up the SQLAlchemy database
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Set up the Kinesis client
kinesis_client = boto3.client("kinesis")

# Define the Forex Exchange Rates model
class ForexExchangeRates(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)

# Define the Stock News Feed model
class StockNewsFeed(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    stock_symbol = db.Column(db.String(255))
    news_item = db.Column(db.Text)

# Define the route for generating the log data
@app.route("/logs")
def generate_logs():
    # Retrieve the forex exchange rates from the database
    forex_exchange_rates = ForexExchangeRates.query.all()
    forex_logs = []
    for rate in forex_exchange_rates:
        forex_logs.append({"currency_pair": rate.currency_pair, "rate": rate.rate})

    stock_price_logs = []
    for price in stock_prices:
        stock_price_logs.append({"stock_symbol": price.stock_symbol, "price": price.price})

    # Retrieve the stock news feed items from the database

    for news_item in stock_news_feed:
        stock_news_feed_logs.append({"stock_symbol": news_item.stock_symbol, "news_item": news_item.news_item})

    # Generate the log data as a JSON object
    logs = {
        "forex_exchange_rates": forex_logs,
        "stock_prices": stock_price_logs,
        "stock_news_feed": stock_news_feed_logs
